# An Integrated Economic Epidemiology Model Minimizing COVID-19 Burden of Disease and Economic Growth Trade-off

## Abstract
We propose an integrated economic-epidemiological model that optimizes lockdown policies by balancing disease control and economic growth. Our model, calibrated using both epidemiological data and economic indicators, offers a more comprehensive approach to pandemic management for policymakers. Our study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in addressing complex global challenges like COVID-19 and sets the stage for future work in economic epidemiology.
