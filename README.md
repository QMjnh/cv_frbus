# An Integrated Economic Epidemiology Model Minimizing COVID-19 Burden of Disease and Economic Growth Trade-off

We propose an integrated economic-epidemiological model that optimizes lockdown policies by balancing disease control and economic growth.

Our study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in addressing complex global challenges like COVID-19 and sets the stage for future work in economic epidemiology.
